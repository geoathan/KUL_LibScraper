# KUL_LibScraper

Java program that scrapes the occupancy from a selected KU Leuven library (cba,agora ... ) and saves the measurements in a file (OccupancyLog.txt).
The measurements can be used for statitical analysis, e.g. finding the average per day or month, or the peak time for a specific day. The program could be expanded to foresee the Occupancy in the libraries.
